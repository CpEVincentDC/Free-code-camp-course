# Learn Lambda Functions by Building an Expense Tracker

In this project, you'll explore the power of Lambda Functions by creating an expense tracker. Lambda functions give you a concise way to write small, throwaway functions in your code. Your resulting app will demonstrate how you can use Lambda Functions for efficient, streamlined operations.

## What are Lambda Functions?

Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions that can be defined using the lambda keyword in Python. They are often used for simple, one-off tasks, and can help make your code more concise and readable.

## Building an Expense Tracker

In this project, you'll build an expense tracker using lambda functions. The tracker will allow you to add, view, and delete expenses, and will demonstrate the power and flexibility of lambda functions.

## Features

Add expenses with a single function call
View all expenses with a single function call
