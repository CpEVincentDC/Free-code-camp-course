# Learn String Manipulation by Building Cipher (FREECODECAMP)

# Python Fundamentals

## Introduction

Python is a powerful and popular programming language widely used for data science, data visualization, web development, game development, machine learning and more.

In this project, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in Python, such as variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements. By building cipher program, you can manipulate the string. You'll use these to code your first programs.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, you can start writing and running your Python programs. You can use a text editor, like Sublime Text or Atom, to write your code, and then run it using the Python interpreter in your terminal or command prompt.

## Project Structure

This project includes the following files:

1. Demonstrates the use of variables in Python.
2. Introduces the concept of functions in Python.
3. Explores different types of loops in Python, such as `for` and `while` loops.
4. Covers conditional statements, such as `if-else` and `elif`, in Python.
5. A file that brings together the concepts covered in the previous files and demonstrates how to use them in a simple program.
